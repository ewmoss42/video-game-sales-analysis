## Overview

This project was developed for the CSE 310 Data Analysis module. The goal of this software is to analyze a real-world dataset of global video game sales using Python. The program performs data cleaning, statistical aggregation, correlation analysis, and visualization to identify trends across genres, platforms, publishers, and global regions.

The software demonstrates key data analysis skills including data preprocessing, grouping, visualization, and generating insights from large datasets.

## Data Analysis Results

The analysis produced several meaningful insights:
- The top-selling genre globally is Action.
- The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is the highest-performing platform by total sales.
- The peak year for global video game sales was 2008.
- Nintendo is the top publisher by total global sales.
- North America is the largest video game market compared to Europe and Japan.
- Strong correlation exists between regional sales and global sales totals.

The program automatically generates charts and statistical outputs to support these findings.
